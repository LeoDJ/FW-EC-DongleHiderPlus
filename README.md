# DongleHider+ Framework Laptop Expansion Card

Want to use a Logitech Unifying Dongle (or similar) without having a dongle permanently sticking out and giving up on a precious expansion card slot?  

Now there's the `DongleHider+`!  

Simply (permanently) mount the dongle inside the card and still have an USB A port available!
